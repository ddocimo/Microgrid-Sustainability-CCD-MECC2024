## Notes

- The function "runThis.m" permits editing of the plant and controller design variables, as well as relevant exogeneous input profiles. It will output relevant trajectories, such as the inputs, certain states, and power flows over time. It will also provide manufacturing-, operation-, and disposal-related sustainability metrics.

- The microgrid model dynamics and controller are as described in the paper.

- If a different file format is requested for this data, please reach out and we'll do our best to accommodate reasonable requests.
